Review:
It was an odyssey to get one of the &#8222;Robot Arm OWI-535&#8220;-kits to my place in Germany. Six weeks after my online order the robot kit finally get here. So there it is.

Let&#8217;s look inside the box.

Whew, looks like a lot of assembly work?! But don&#8217;t worry, you learn how the mechanics work and the great assembly instruction tell you everything you need to know, by very detailed pictures.

After two to three hours the OWI-535 is fully assembled.

Let&#8217;s look how it moves:



Well controlling the robot is quite tricky, maybe I should use a microcontroller instead of my hands, but that&#8217;s part of an other project.
