With this nice plugin you can forward your Blog&#8217;s comments right to your Nabaztag.

You just have to get your Nabaztag&#8217;s serialnumber plus securitytoken and activate API access on http://my.nabaztag.com/

Then download the plugin, copy it to your plugin-folder and set the values. After having done that, you&#8217;re visitors start to speak to you through you&#8217;re Nabaztag. Coole aye?

I have added support for different voices and cool choreographies, but test it internally now.

I&#8217;d like to get feedback from you, if you use the plugin. Which features shall I add?
