I have a couple of new pcbs in development. Firstly there is the lightning-sensor-shield. It uses a AS3935 sensor from AMS to detect lightning. I&#8217;m pretty excited to get this one running.

Then we have a power LED nano shield. You plug it onto an Arduino Nano. It&#8217;s possible to dim the power LED (350mA) via PWM. And there is also a touch switch on the back of the board to turn the LED on and off.

And finally there is the current shunt monitor board. It measures the current going through the shunt resistor.
