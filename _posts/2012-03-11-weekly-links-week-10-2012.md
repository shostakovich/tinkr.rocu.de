## [How 30 Minutes a Day Can Increase Your Intelligence](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/how-half-an-hour-a-day-can-increase-your-intelligence.html)

I totally agree. It also prevents you from burning out or getting stuck in your live. Stop wasting your time consuming stuff passively! Plan what you want to learn/consume and get it done..

## [Frighteningly ambitious startup ideas](http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html)

Mr. Graham is right. Some of these ideas are so big, that I would never consider to pursue them directly. What I love about the essay is the section &ldquo;Tactics&rdquo; at the end..

## [Ask For Forgiveness Programming - Or How We&rsquo;ll Program 1000 Cores](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/6/ask-for-forgiveness-programming-or-how-well-program-1000-cor.html)

I really like this way of solving problems. Slightly redefine the requirements and new, ingenious solutions like this one might emerge ðŸ˜‰

## [Dark Matter Developers: The Unseen 99%](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx)

To me it is not important if you are visible or not. Its important that you love what you are doing and want to get better at it.

# [The Personal Analytics of My Life](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/)

Amazing post! I track my weight online since a while and I have also a nice body of emailsâ€¦ Makes me really want to do something similar.

# [How A Russian Developer Hijacked Github To Help The Rails Community](http://tech.li/2012/03/how-a-russian-developer-hijacked-github-to-help-the-rails-community/)

I am not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand i&rsquo;m not happy about the security flaw - on the other hand I think Egor did not behave like an adult. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that he made the live @Github pretty miserable in the last week.

As long as a company reacts to an email and fixes a vulnerability within a reasonable amount of time you should not do something malicious with your finding.
