The &#8222;Hexy&#8220; is a hexypod roboter from Kickstarter. As always it took quite long until I received it and some parts were missing. Fortunately they were easy to replace. The manual made it pretty easy to put everything together.

Here is what I experienced during the assembly:

At first I assembled the six legs:


<div id="attachment_3304" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3304" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2013/04/hexy_hexypod_01.jpg" alt="hexys legs"    />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3304" >
    hexys legs
  </p>
</div>

Second came the middle plattform


<div id="attachment_3305" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3305" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2013/04/hexy_hexypod_02.jpg" alt="electronic plattform"    />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3305" >
    electronic plattform
  </p>
</div>

A small part wasnmissing, so I created a 3D modell out of the DXF-files available from Github and printed it. It only took 15 minutes.


<div id="attachment_3306" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3306" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2013/04/hexy_hexypod_03.jpg" alt="3d printed part for ultrasonic range finder"    />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3306" >
    3d printed part for ultrasonic range finder
  </p>
</div>

Then I combined the legs and the plattform


<div id="attachment_3307" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3307" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2013/04/hexy_hexypod_04.jpg" alt="put legs and plattform together"    />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3307" >
    put legs and plattform together
  </p>
</div>

The finished Hexy looks like this:


<div id="attachment_3308" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3308" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2013/04/hexy_hexypod_05.jpg" alt="finished Hexy"    />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3308" >
    finished Hexy
  </p>
</div>

After 6 hours of assembly work it does also move ðŸ˜‰ Have a look at this video:



I had to use 5 Eneloop batteries to power it. One more then recommended. Still it has some problems when trying to &#8222;get up&#8220;.
