This spring we builded a L-shaped raised bed out of gabions in our garden. On the raised bed I planted some tomatoes.

Tomatoes are not happy with direct rain. So I had to build a shelter for the tomatoe plants. I created a greenhouse out of some air bubble film, some cheap wooden strip and 3d printed brackets.

The greenhouse had to fit over the 500x500x500mm part of the raised bed, so I choose the following dimensions: 1400x700x540mm

</div>

1. step: print the brackets

There are overal 16 brackets inside the wooden frame. They keept my 3D printer busy for a while ðŸ˜‰


<div id="attachment_3591" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3591" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2014/07/diy_green-house_05.jpg" alt="bracket"    />

  </p>
</div>

You can download the stl-file for the brackets here: <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:393876>

2. step: get some 35x17mm wooden strips and cut them according to the desired sizes (e.g. see sketch above).

3. step: assemble the frame

  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3588" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2014/07/diy_green-house_02.jpg" alt="green house frame"    />

  </p>
</div>

(optional step: paint the frame)

4. step: staple the air bubble film onto the frame


<div id="attachment_3589" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3589" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2014/07/diy_green-house_03.jpg" alt="green house during construction"    />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3589" >

  </p>
</div>

5. step: put the greenhouse in place


<div id="attachment_3590" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3590" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2014/07/diy_green-house_04.jpg" alt="raised bed with green house"    />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3590" >

  </p>
</div>

The front side of the air bubble film is not stapled to the frame, so you can easily access the plants inside. To secure the front side we used some velcro stripes.

5. step: plant something and wait ðŸ™‚
