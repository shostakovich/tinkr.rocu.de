Every time I&#8217;m on a business trip with the German bullet train _ICE_, the overhead rack is full of black suitcases. Often there&#8217;s another Rimowa case next to my one.

One way to avoid confusion when picking your case from the rack when leaving the train, is to put some kind of unique luggage tag onto your case.

I went one step further and put an URL sticker on the front of the case.

<div id="attachment_3541" style="width: 616px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3541" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2014/03/suitcase_url_sticker.jpg" alt="Suitcase with URL sticker" width="606" height="705" class="size-full wp-image-3541" />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3541" class="wp-caption-text">
    Suitcase with URL sticker
  </p>
</div>
