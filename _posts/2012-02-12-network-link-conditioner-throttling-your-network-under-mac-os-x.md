At home, we have a pretty slow internet connection. So whenever I perform my online backup, I hear cries of dismay since Hulu stops playing.Â So after trying to find a nice and simple solution for throttling my network throughput I found a system preference called &#8222;Network Link Conditioner&#8220;.

It comes bundled with XCode. You can find it under:

`/Applications/Utilities/Network Link Conditioner/`

Double click and you will have it in your system preferences. I know that there are more advanced ways of doing it - but you should have a look at this. For me its good enough.
