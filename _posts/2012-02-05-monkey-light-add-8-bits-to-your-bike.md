I recently supported a Kickstarter.com project: [Mini Monkey Light - 8-Bit Bike Light](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/minimonkey/mini-monkey-light-wheel-lights-for-bicycles?ref=live).
It is a rugged, practical, high performance bike light that keeps you visible in all weather conditions. The Mini Monkey will be straped to the bikes spokes and displays 8-bit graphics on the spinning bike wheel. The bright and colorful display is visible from all angles, and it makes riding in the evening even more fun than the daytime.



The shipping to Germany took it&#8217;s time, about four weeks or so. I received the package just this week. I ordered 2 Monkey Lights. Here you can see what is inside the package:

The battery pack holds 3 AA batteries. A rubber seal prevents moisture to get inside the battery pack. The light electronics are enclosed in flexible clear plastic.

And here is a little demo:
