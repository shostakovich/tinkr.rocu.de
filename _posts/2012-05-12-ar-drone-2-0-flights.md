I preorderd the AR.Drone last week at Amazon and it finally arrived here yesterday.

The drone comes fully assembled in a huge box. Inside you&#8217;ll find these components:

Additionally there is also a charger for the LiPo-battery. The battery has a capacity of 1000mAh.

The drone can be controlled by an smartphone or tablet (e.g. iPhone, iPad, Android phones) over wifi. You can also capture the video from the drone to your tablet or phone.

In the App AR.FreeFlight 2.0 from Parrot you can control the drone, watch the captured movies and upload new firmware to the drone.

This is the control panel. With the left virtual stick you can control forward and backwards and with right stick up and down and turn left and right. The buttons TAKE OFF will start the rotors and lift the drone up to 0.7m. Hitting the button EMERGENCY will immediately turn off the rotors.

Here is a video from a test flight in my garden.
