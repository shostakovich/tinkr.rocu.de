Now it&#8217;s summer and our garden is in full bloom. And to keep all the plants alive on a hot summer day you can run twice a day with a watering can from a faucet to the plants back and forth, or you a hose - or you simply automize this task with a irrigation system.
We have a combination of two irrigation systems, one from the UK brand Hozelock and the German Gardena.

In the last week I expanded the number of drippers to supply the water to all the raspberry plants. I bought enough drippers and pips, but forgot to buy the pegs.
But this is not a seriously problem, I just printed some with my 3D printer:
