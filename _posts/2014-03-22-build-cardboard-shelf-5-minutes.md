What do you do, when you need a small shelf, the next Ikea store is miles away and you don&#8217;t have a car to get there?

You build your own, out of the many cardboard boxes that you get when you order online.

<div id="attachment_3546" style="width: 616px" >
  <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3546" loading="lazy" src="/assets/2014/03/cardbord_shelf.jpg" alt="Cardboard shelf"    srcset="/assets/2014/03/cardbord_shelf.jpg 606w, /assets/2014/03/cardbord_shelf-240x180.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" />

  <p id="caption-attachment-3546" >
    Cardboard shelf
  </p>
</div>

The shelf has 2 levels and I combined 2 card boxes from the same shop.

The result is a pretty stable little shelf that we use for our telco equipment. It does not look like an Ikea shelf of course but it&#8217;s free and much better for the environment ðŸ™‚
