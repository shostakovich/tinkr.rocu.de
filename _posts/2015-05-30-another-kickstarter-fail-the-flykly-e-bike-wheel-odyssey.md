Look at this video, where they tell you how easy it is to turn your bike, every bike into an e-bike within minutes.

Ha, that was easy, right?

After receiving the Flykly wheel, only with one year delay, I was very eager to turn my bike as well into an e-bike. And guess what, it totally didn&#8217;t work, even after hours of fiddling.

First of all, the guys were totally ignorant to research the situation with the common bike tracks. As far as I know, geared bikes usually have little smaller tracks then single speed bikes. So my bike didn&#8217;t work with the Flykly, the track was falling off when I was trying to take a ride with my modified bike. The Flykly-wheel seems to be designed especially for singled speed bikes, demanding a bigger sized track.

After I wrote this to the Flykly support, they send me to a slowenic bike e-shop, that rarely reads it&#8217;s emails. And they wanted me to change the sprocket by my self with an arsenal of tools.

I was trying to avoid this adventurous modification and bought a cheap single speed bike instead. This time, it got the right track size. But guess what, the wheel/track tensioners didn&#8217;t fit on the Flykly bike, so it couldn&#8217;t be pulled away from the frame. You can&#8217;t get far with a wheel that scratches at the frame.
So I bought some track tensioners with the Flykly&#8217;s diameter (around 12mm), but they where to big after all to pull the wheel away from the frame. So this approach didn&#8217;t worked again.

Finally I gave the single speed bike back and bought me a real e-bike from the German brand Ghost. And guess what, it does work without any issues so far.

### Conclusion

Everybody can turn their bikes into an e-bike, ok not everybody, only if you are a real bike professional and you are not using the Flykly wheel.
