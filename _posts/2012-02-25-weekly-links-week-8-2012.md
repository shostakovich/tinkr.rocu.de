This week I was ill. I dind&rsquo;t enjoy it - all I was able to do is to throw all the stories with interessting titles into Instapaper. And read them this morning.

Some of these links contain real wisdom and made me think and the link &ldquo;game of thrones&rdquo; made me laugh hard üôÇ I also like that next week, when I am out of bed - there is 1 nice new Codeschool course waiting for me.
