This week I attended an Udemy course by ST Micro about the STM32F7 Discovery Board. It was a great, interactive experience since ST also send me the STM32F7 Discovery Board to try all the hands-on labs for myself.

This MOOC course was the first of its kind and trough the interactive hands-on labs it was able to transport much more information than a one hour webinar.

The Udemy course explained many of the STM32F7 capabilities. The DSP functionalities are amazing. The course students used the IAR Workbench and some prebuild projects.
