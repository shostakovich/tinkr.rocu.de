I replaced my old Omron pedometer with the Withings Pulse.

The OLED display and the design are nice. However it has one design flaw - it&#8217;s impossible to attach the little device to your trousers in a secure way.

It&#8217;s really easy to loose the Withings Pulse with the original mount, when you are using it every day in an very active way.

So why not create my own pouch? Said and done.

As source material I used some fabric from a side pocket of a wasted outdoor jacket. The fabric is durable and you can also see the OLED display through it.

This is how I wear Withings Pulse:

I know, I&#8217;m not a tailor - the pouch looks a little bit crappy. It was my second time using a sewing machine.
