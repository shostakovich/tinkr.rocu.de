Two spring mountings of my couch were broken. So it was time for a repair. Here is what I did:

First I put my couch up side down.

I designed a new 3D part at tinkercad.com.

(You can view, modify, download and print the 3d design.)

Next I printed the part on my Printrbot:

Here is the comparison of the CAD model and the printed part:

The new mountings were fixed with a metal band:

Like new:
