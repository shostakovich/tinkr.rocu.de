Slowly it is getting cold outside. And like lots of other people my hands can get quite cold. A hand warmer is a neat way to warm your cold hands.

In our little experiment today we would like to answer the following questions:
-How does a handwarmer look like through IR?
-How warm does it get?
-And how long does it last?

### CMOS images:

-the animations starts with a clear fluid in the hand warmer:

### Diagramm:



### Conclusion:

The temperature rises very fast to the maximum of 51.6°C and drops then to around 28°C after 2h.

note: in our experiment the hand warmer was exposed to free air convection from the top side. So it could last longer if your jacket pocket is isolated very good.
