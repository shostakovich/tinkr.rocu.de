What could be better to start a Saturday morning, than a cup of tea boiled with the heat of the sun. â€” Ok, maybe a cruise in the Caribbean ðŸ˜‰



Last month I picked up this used Solar Cooker for around 60â‚¬. It has a diameter of about 70cm and is made out of aluminum. It does not have the high power as the ones with 140cm diameter (that cost around 350â‚¬), but it is enough to boil half liter in 20 minutes.
