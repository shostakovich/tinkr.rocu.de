Currently I don&#8217;t find the time to blog regularly. Instead I will publish some links once in a while.

### Codeschool

[Codeschool](http://www.codeschool.com/) is a website, which publishes nice tech-courses on a regular basis. They consist of videos + an interactive part, where you have to solve quizzes. I find this way of learning most entertaining. It sticks much better then to read a book. As a bonus you get a nice [public profile](http://www.codeschool.com/users/rocu), that you can use to brag about how much you learn.

### Treehouse

[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) offers a introduction to Webdevelopment and iOS-Programming. The course consists of Videos, Quizzes and Code challenges. Its more addressed at beginners then at pros, but I found that its worth revisiting the basics after a few years. The explanation of the topics is really sound and I was supprised that I missed some subtleties of perfect markup.

I highly recommend it to beginners. In my opinion this way of learning is way better then buying a books and reading

### Destroy All Software

[Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/) is an awesome paid screencast. A new video is published weekly. Topics are Unix, Git, Testing, Ruby, Vim and good OO Design.

### Clean Coders

[Clean Coders](http://www.cleancoders.com/) is a series of videos created by &#8222;Uncle Bob&#8220; Martin. I really like his &#8222;special&#8220; style and had some good laughs, as he appeared as Spock. He pays much attention to presentation and keeps you engaged for hours.

### Peepcode

[PeepCode Screencasts](http://www.peepcode.com/) are awesome. They cover all kinds of topics: Rails, Js, Testing, Productivity, UX Sketching and many more. The presentation is awesome and they are perfect to get you started in a topic.

### Pragmatic Programmers

I am a big fan of the books of the [Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/). They are worth every single cent. They cool features like automatic push to your Kindle on every update of the book.

**Happy learning ðŸ˜‰**
