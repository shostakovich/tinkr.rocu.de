On this page I will puplish some selfwritten tools, which might be useful for embedded systems development.
Please note, that the programs may contain bugs, so you use them at your own risk. The programs are intended for private use only.
All programs are written in Visual C#. The latest .net-runtime must be installed.

This tool converts a bmp-file to a *.h-file that you can easily include in your project to draw bitmaps on a Nokia6100 compatible LCD.
